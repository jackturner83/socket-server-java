# Java Socket Server
This is a simple socket server created in Java that allows clients to connect and exchange messages. The server listens on a specified port (default is 1234) and can handle multiple clients concurrently using threads.

# Usage
To run the server, compile the Server.java file and run the resulting Server.class file:
```
javac Server.java
java Server
```
The server will start listening on port 1234 (you can change this by modifying the port variable in the Server.java file). Clients can connect to the server using a telnet client or any other client that supports TCP/IP connections. Once connected, clients can exchange messages with the server by typing them in and pressing enter.

# Server Architecture
The server is implemented using the Java ServerSocket and Socket classes. The server listens on a specified port using a ServerSocket object, and when a client connects, the ServerSocket returns a new Socket object representing the connection. The server uses a separate thread for each client connection to handle incoming and outgoing messages.

The ClientHandler class is responsible for handling client connections. When a new client connects, a new ClientHandler object is created, which starts a new thread to handle incoming messages. The ClientHandler reads messages from the client using a BufferedReader and writes messages to the client using a PrintWriter.

The Server class is responsible for starting the server and accepting incoming client connections. The Server listens on a specified port using a ServerSocket object and creates a new ClientHandler object for each new client connection. The Server also handles shutting down the server and closing all client connections when the server is stopped.

# Planned Improvements
This is a simple implementation of a socket server and there are many ways it could be improved. Here are some ideas for future improvements:

* Add support for encryption and authentication to improve security.
* Implement a GUI for the server to make it easier to start and stop the server and view connected clients.
* Add support for broadcasting messages to all connected clients.
* Implement a message protocol to ensure messages are received and processed correctly by the server and clients.
* Add support for asynchronous I/O to improve performance and scalability.
